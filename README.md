   * **Categories & Filters**: Products are categorized and can be filtered by various attributes, allowing users to quickly find items that meet their needs.
   * **Product Cards**: Each product has its own card, displaying key details such as product image, title, price, and star ratings. Hover effects provide additional information, such as quick access to add to cart.

3. **Shopping Cart:**

   * **Cart Summary**: The total price, including any applicable taxes and discounts, is displayed, allowing users to review their purchase before checkout.

4. **Checkout Process:**

5. **Responsive Design:**

   * Media queries and CSS Flexbox are used to ensure content is displayed correctly on any device.

6. **Login/Registration Toggle:**
